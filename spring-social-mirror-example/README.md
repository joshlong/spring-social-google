Spring Social Google Quickstart
========================
This sample is designed to get you up and running quickly.

To run, simply import the project into your IDE and deploy to a Servlet 3 (or better) container such as Tomcat 7. You can also deploy from the command line with:

```$ mvn tomcat:run```

Access the project at `http://localhost:8080/spring-social-quickstart`. Discuss at [the Spring Social Forum](forum.springsource.org) and collaborate with the development team on [the project JIRA](jira.springframework.org/browse/SOCIAL).
